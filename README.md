# new-calculator
This is my 2nd attempt at building a calculator after botching the first attempt. My first attempt had become extremely convoluted, to the extent that I couldn't even follow my own logic, which made solving problems virtually impossible. This is an attempt to hit the reset button and make a calculator which is written in a more consistent and logical manner, building on the lessons from my first attempt.
