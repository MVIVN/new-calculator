This is my 2nd attempt at building a calculator after botching the first attempt. My first attempt had become extremely convoluted, to the extent that I couldn't even follow my own logic, which made solving problems virtually impossible. This is an attempt to hit the reset button and make a calculator which is written in a more consistent and logical manner, building on the lessons from my first attempt.

This calculator is the final project of The Odin Project's Foundations course.

# Update: Monday 29 August 2022
After a lot of trials and tribulations, my calculator is finally complete. I was able to successfully impelent a history button and confirmed that all aspects of the calculator are working as expected, and meet all the required criteria set out by the assignment.

In terms of lessons learnt, there were a lot! I had to stretch my current JavaScript skills to their limit to make a functional calculator, and a lot of thought went into error-handling since there are multiple different ways to "break" a calculator, so that was a huge aspect of tackling a project like this.

For next steps, I definitely need to work on the layout and CSS to make it more responsive for different screen sizes. In its current state, it is only suitable to view on a full HD monitor. I'd also like to incorporate the ability to use the keyboard for user input, and I'd also like to add additional scientific functions for the calculator to make it a bit more capable than it currently is.

This project was definitely the most challenging and time-consuming of all the Odin Project Foundations course assignments, which is fitting as this is the final assignment before moving on to the main study path. I can't wait to learn a lot more, and revisit this project with more knowledge and skills under my belt.
